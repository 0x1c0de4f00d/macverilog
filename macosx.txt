This file describes the procedure to build and install Icarus Verilog
on Mac OS X.  I assume that you have experience with Unix and
Terminal.app and a basic knowledge of how to download, compile and
install software from source form.


1)  Obtain and install a libdl compatibility library.

  If you don't already have /usr/local/lib/libdl.{a,dylib} and
  /usr/local/include/dlfcn.h, you can obtain the source for a
  compatibility layer from at least one of two places:

  http://download.sourceforge.net/fink/dlcompat-20010831.tar.gz
  http://www.omnigroup.com/~bungi/dlcompat-20010831.tar.gz

  Unpack this tar file and read the README and Makefile.  Install the
  library according to the instructions.  Installation in /usr/local
  is strongly recommended since otherwise autoconf very likely won't
  be able to find it.

2) Make sure you have a copy of the 'gperf' tool.  This does not come
   with the Mac OS X 10.1 developer tools, so you probably don't.  You
   can check with:

     %  which gperf

  If not found, grab a gperf source package and install it. See "GPERF
   FOR MACOSX" below.

  Snapshots of Icarus Verilog source now come with the
  lexor_keyword.cc file pre-made, so if you have trouble with gperf,
  then just make sure the distributed lexor_keyword.cc is newer then
  lexor_keyword.gperf, and use that.

3)  Configure, build and install the Icarus Verilog sources as normal.

  The only change you need to make here is to use a configure command like:

    % CC="cc -no-cpp-precomp" ./configure

  This assumes you are using 'sh', 'zsh', or 'bash'.  If you are using
  'csh' or 'tcsh', then you'll want something like:

    % setenv CC "cc -no-cpp-precomp"
    % ./configure

  You can, of course, add other configure options.


4) Done!


GPERF FOR MACOSX

  Get version 2.7.2 of gperf from here:

    <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gperf/gperf-2.7.2.tar.gz>

  Get a MacosX patch from here:

    http://www.eternal.nest.or.jp/~shiro/binaries/gperf-2.7.2-macosx-patch.gz

  Apply the patch to the gperf-2.7.2 source that you previously
  downloaded, then follow the remaining gperf installation
  instructions.
