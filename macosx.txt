  This file describes the procedure to build and install Icarus Verilog on Mac OS X.  I assume that you have experience with Unix and Terminal.app.


1)  Obtain and install a libdl compatibility library.

  If you don't already have /usr/local/lib/libdl.{a,dylib} and /usr/local/include/dlfcn.h, you can obtain the source for a compatibility layer from at least one of two places:

  http://download.sourceforge.net/fink/dlcompat-20010831.tar.gz
  http://www.omnigroup.com/~bungi/dlcompat-20010831.tar.gz

  Unpack this tar file and read the README and Makefile.  Install the library according to the instructions.  Installation in /usr/local is strongly recommended since otherwise autoconf very likely won't be able to find it.

2) Make sure you have a copy of the 'gperf' tool.  This does not come with the Mac OS X 10.1 developer tools, so you probably don't.  You can check with:

  %  which gperf

  If not found, grab a gperf source package and install it.

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gperf/gperf-2.7.2.tar.gz


3)  Configure, build and install the Icarus Verilog sources as normal.

  The only change you need to make here is to use a configure command like:

    % CC="cc -no-cpp-precomp" ./configure

  This assumes you are using 'sh', 'zsh', or 'bash'.  If you are using 'csh' or 'tcsh', then you'll want something like:

    % setenv CC "cc -no-cpp-precomp"
    % ./configure

  You can, of course, add other configure options.

4) Done!
