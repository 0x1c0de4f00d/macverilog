The ivl_target API is the interface available to modules that the
Icarus Verilog compiler loads to act as a code generator. The API
provides an interface to the elaborated, possibly synthesized, design
for code generators that are intended to write netlist files or
executable programs.

The functions and types of the API are summarized in the ivl_target.h
header file. This ducument describes how the functions and types of
the API are used to access and interpret the netlist of the design.


LPM DEVICES

All LPM devices support a small set of common LPM functions, as
described in the ivl_target header file.

* IVL_LPM_UFUNC

This LPM represents a user defined function. It is a way to connect
behavioral code into a structural network. The UFUNC device has a
vector output and a set of inputs.

The output vector is accessible through the ivl_lpm_q, and the output
has the width defined by ivl_lpm_width. This similar to most every
other LPM device with outputs.
