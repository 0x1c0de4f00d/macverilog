INTERACTIVE ASSEMBLY DEBUGGER

The VVP runtime includes an interactive runtime debugger that allows
the expert user to trace the actions of the VVP simulation. It is
entered just before simulation starts if the user uses the -d flag to
the vvp command, and it is also entered when an interesting breakpoint
is triggered. The -d flag is useful for giving the user a chance to
set breakpoints.

DEBUGGER COMMANDS

* go

Resume the simulation. The simulation will continue until the next
breakpoint, or until the simulation ends.

* lookup <symbol>...

Give a symbol name, and this function will look up that symbol and
return the type and address.

fbreak <address>...

Set the breakpoint on a given functor address. (Use the lookup
function to locate the address.)
