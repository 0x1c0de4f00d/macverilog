THREAD DETAILS

Thread objects in vvp are created by ``.thread'' statements in the
input source file. These cause

A thread object includes a program counter and private bit
registers. The program counter is used to step the processor through
the code space as it executes instructions. The bit registers are for
use by the arithmetic operators as they operate.

Instructions that use the bit registers have as an operand a <bit>
value. There is space in the instruction for 2 <bit> operands. The
special values 0, 1, 2 and 3 are special constant bits 0, 1, x and z
and are used as immediate values for instructions that take single-bit
values. The remaining of 64K possible <bit> values are read-write bit
registers that can be accessed singly or as vectors.
