THE IVL PREPROCESSOR

The ivlpp command is a verilog preprocessor that handles file
inclusion and macro substitution. The program runs separate from the
actual compiler so as to ease the task of the compiler proper, and
provide a means of preprocessing files off-line.


USAGE:

	ivlpp [options] <file>

The <file> parameter is the name of the file to be read and
preprocessed. The resulting output is sent to standard output. The
valid options include:

	-Dname[=value]
	    Predefine the symbol ``name'' to have the specified
	    value. If the value is not specified, then ``1'' is
	    used. This is mostly of use for controlling conditional
	    compilaiton.

	    This option does *not* override existing `define
	    directives in the source file.

	-I <dir>
	    Add a directory to the include path. Normally, only "." is
	    in the search path. The -I flag causes other directories
	    to be searched for a named file. There may be as many -I
	    flags as needed.

	-L
	    Add to the output #line directives. The ivl compiler
	    understands these directives and uses them to keep track
	    of the current line of the original source file. This
	    makes error messages more meaningful.

	-o <file>
	    Send the output to the named file, instead of to standard
	    output.

	-v
	    Print version and copyright information


LOCATING INCLUDED FILES

The ivlpp preprocessor implements the `include directives by
substituting the contents of the included file in place of the line
with the `include directive. The name that the programmer specifies is
a file name. Normally, the preprocessor looks in the current working
directory for the named file. However, the ``-I'' flags can be used to
specify a path of directories to search for named include files. The
current directory will be searched first, followed by all the include
directories in the order that the -I flag appears.

The exception to this process is include files that have a name that
starts with the '/' character. These file names are ``rooted names''
and must be in the rooted location specified.
