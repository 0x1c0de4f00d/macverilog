THE IVL PREPROCESSOR

The ivlpp command is a verilog preprocessor that handles file
inclusion and macro substitution. The program runs separate from the
actual compiler so as to ease the task of the compiler proper, and
provide a means of preprocessing files off-line.

USAGE:

	ivlpp <file>

The <file> parameter is the name of the file to be read and
preprocessed. The resulting output is sent to standard output.
